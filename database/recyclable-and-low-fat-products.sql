# 'SELECT' is used to specify the columns that we want to retrieve from the table Products. In this scenario, we want to retrieve the product_id column.
# 'WHERE' is used to filter the rows in the table Products based on specific conditions, which the low_fats column has the value "Y" (indicating low-fat products) and the recyclable column has the value "Y" (indicating recyclable products). 
# We use the logical operator 'AND' to combine both conditions, ensuring that the final result includes only product IDs for products that are both low fat and recyclable.

SELECT product_id FROM Products
WHERE low_fats='Y' AND recyclable = 'Y'
